### Problems: 

#### A. Optional tasks (individual): 
There is no required team task in SP5. This is an optional assignment (for 
individual submission only), with deadline at the end of the semester. 
**Important:** elegance of code, code reuse from BST, and implementation of 
single pass algorithms, where possible.

**Problem 1.** 
   Extend BST to AVL trees (AVLTree).  Starter code: AVLTree.java.

**Solution:** [AVLTree.java]() 


**Problem 2.** 
   Extend BST to Red Black Trees (RedBlacktree).  Starter code: RedBlackTree.java.

**Solution:** [RedBlackTree.java]()

**Problem 3.** 
   Extend BST to Splay Trees (SplayTree).  Implement bottom-up splaying.
   Include in your submission, code that generates a random sequence of
   add/remove/contains operations, with skewed distributions.  Experiment and
   find probability distributions for which the splay tree is faster than BST
   or Java's TreeMap for a sequence of n operations by at least 10%,
   for large n (say, 10M+).  The probability distribution need not be uniform,
   but every element should have a non-zero probability of being chosen for contains/remove.
   Starter code: SplayTree.java.

**Solution:** [SplayTree.java]()
